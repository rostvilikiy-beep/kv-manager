## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **WebSocket-based Real-time Progress Tracking**: All bulk operations now use WebSocket connections for live progress updates
  - Async processing via Cloudflare Durable Objects for bulk delete, copy, TTL update, and tag operations
  - Real-time progress updates showing current key being processed, processed count, error count, and completion percentage
  - WebSocket connections managed by Durable Objects using the Hibernation API for cost efficiency
  - Automatic fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket connection fails or is not supported
  - Exponential backoff reconnection strategy for dropped WebSocket connections
  - Progress dialog component (`BulkProgressDialog`) showing detailed operation status
  - Custom React hook (`useBulkJobProgress`) for managing WebSocket/polling lifecycle

- **Enhanced Import/Export Operations**:
  - Import and export operations now run asynchronously with real-time progress tracking
  - Export files are temporarily stored in Durable Object storage and served via dedicated download endpoint
  - Automatic download trigger when export job completes
  - Live progress updates during large import/export operations

- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time job progress updates
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/download` - Download endpoint for completed export files

- **Database Schema Enhancements**:
  - Added `current_key` column to `bulk_jobs` table to track the key currently being processed
  - Added `percentage` column to `bulk_jobs` table to store completion percentage (0-100)

### Changed
- **Bulk Operations Architecture**:
  - Refactored all bulk operations (delete, copy, TTL, tag) to be asynchronous
  - Operations now return immediately with `job_id`, `status`, and `ws_url` instead of waiting for completion
  - Progress tracking moved from simple status checks to detailed WebSocket-based updates
  - Bulk operations now show detailed progress: X of Y keys processed, current key name, percentage
  
- **Import/Export Flow**:
  - Export operations no longer block the HTTP request
  - Import operations process files asynchronously in the background
  - Export results are served from Durable Object storage instead of inline response

- **Frontend User Experience**:
  - Progress dialog now shows real-time updates instead of static loading spinner
  - Users can see which key is currently being processed
  - Connection status indicator shows whether using WebSocket or polling fallback
  - Auto-close progress dialog on successful completion after brief delay

### Technical Improvements
- Implemented two Durable Object classes:
  - `BulkOperationDO` - Handles bulk delete, copy, TTL, and tag operations
  - `ImportExportDO` - Handles import and export operations with file storage
- Added proper TypeScript type definitions for all WebSocket messages and job parameters
- Implemented graceful error handling and recovery for WebSocket connections
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging WebSocket connections and job processing
- Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript linting errors related to React hooks and Workers types

### Fixed
- React hooks immutability issues in `useBulkJobProgress` hook
- Circular dependency in WebSocket connection callback
- TypeScript type compatibility issues between DOM and Cloudflare Workers WebSocket types
- Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections and polling intervals on component unmount
