## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Operation Cancellation Support**: Users can now cancel in-progress bulk operations
  - Cancel button appears in progress dialog during `queued` or `running` operations
  - WebSocket-based cancellation via `{ type: "cancel", jobId }` message protocol
  - Graceful cancellation: operations complete current batch/item before stopping
  - Job status updates to `cancelled` in D1 database
  - Cancellation events logged to `job_audit_events` table with partial progress
  - Visual feedback: orange status indicator, cancelled summary with processed counts
  - Cancel button disabled when WebSocket is not connected (polling fallback limitation)
  - Cancelled jobs auto-close progress dialog after 5 seconds

- **Job Audit Event Logging**: Comprehensive lifecycle event tracking for all bulk operations and import/export jobs
  - New `job_audit_events` D1 table stores milestone events: `started`, `progress_25`, `progress_50`, `progress_75`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`
  - Events include detailed JSON metadata: processed counts, error counts, percentages, and operation-specific data
  - User-based access control: users can only view events for their own jobs
  - Foundation for job history viewing and event replay functionality
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/events` - Returns chronological event history for a specific job

- **WebSocket-based Real-time Progress Tracking**: All bulk operations now use WebSocket connections for live progress updates
  - Async processing via Cloudflare Durable Objects for bulk delete, copy, TTL update, and tag operations
  - Real-time progress updates showing current key being processed, processed count, error count, and completion percentage
  - WebSocket connections managed by Durable Objects using the Hibernation API for cost efficiency
  - Automatic fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket connection fails or is not supported
  - Exponential backoff reconnection strategy for dropped WebSocket connections
  - Progress dialog component (`BulkProgressDialog`) showing detailed operation status
  - Custom React hook (`useBulkJobProgress`) for managing WebSocket/polling lifecycle

- **Enhanced Import/Export Operations**:
  - Import and export operations now run asynchronously with real-time progress tracking
  - Export files are temporarily stored in Durable Object storage and served via dedicated download endpoint
  - Automatic download trigger when export job completes
  - Live progress updates during large import/export operations

- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time job progress updates
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/download` - Download endpoint for completed export files
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/events` - Retrieve audit event history for a specific job (user-authorized)

- **Database Schema Enhancements**:
  - Added `current_key` column to `bulk_jobs` table to track the key currently being processed
  - Added `percentage` column to `bulk_jobs` table to store completion percentage (0-100)
  - Added `job_audit_events` table with foreign key to `bulk_jobs` for lifecycle event tracking
  - Indexed by `job_id` and `user_email` for efficient querying
  - Schema already supports `cancelled` status in `bulk_jobs.status` and `job_audit_events.event_type`

### Changed
- **Bulk Operations Architecture**:
  - Refactored all bulk operations (delete, copy, TTL, tag) to be asynchronous
  - Operations now return immediately with `job_id`, `status`, and `ws_url` instead of waiting for completion
  - Progress tracking moved from simple status checks to detailed WebSocket-based updates
  - Bulk operations now show detailed progress: X of Y keys processed, current key name, percentage
  
- **Import/Export Flow**:
  - Export operations no longer block the HTTP request
  - Import operations process files asynchronously in the background
  - Export results are served from Durable Object storage instead of inline response

- **Frontend User Experience**:
  - Progress dialog now shows real-time updates instead of static loading spinner
  - Users can see which key is currently being processed
  - Connection status indicator shows whether using WebSocket or polling fallback
  - Auto-close progress dialog on successful completion after brief delay
  - Cancel button with loading state during cancellation
  - Visual distinction for cancelled operations (orange indicator, dedicated summary section)

### Technical Improvements
- Implemented two Durable Object classes:
  - `BulkOperationDO` - Handles bulk delete, copy, TTL, and tag operations with milestone event logging and cancellation support
  - `ImportExportDO` - Handles import and export operations with file storage, milestone event logging, and cancellation support
- Added `logJobEvent()` helper function in `worker/utils/helpers.ts` for consistent event logging
- Added `JobAuditEvent` TypeScript interface for type-safe event handling
- All 6 operation methods (bulk copy, delete, TTL, tag, import, export) now log milestone events automatically
- Events stored indefinitely in D1 for complete job history tracking
- Added proper TypeScript type definitions for all WebSocket messages and job parameters
- Implemented graceful error handling and recovery for WebSocket connections
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging WebSocket connections and job processing
- Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript linting errors related to React hooks and Workers types
- Cancellation logic integrated into all 6 operation processing methods (copy, delete, TTL, tag, import, export)
- Added `cancelledJobs: Set<string>` to track cancellation requests in Durable Objects
- `cancelJob()` function in `useBulkJobProgress` hook sends cancellation messages via WebSocket
- `handleCancellation()` helper method in both Durable Objects for consistent cancellation handling
- TypeScript types updated: `JobProgress.status` now includes `'cancelled'` in all type definitions
- Cancel button component in `BulkProgressDialog` with appropriate disabled states and visual feedback

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: WebSocket connection loop causing 429 rate limit errors
  - Added parameter validation in `useBulkJobProgress` hook to prevent connection attempts with empty jobId or wsUrl
  - Added conditional guard in `BulkProgressDialog` to only invoke hook when dialog is open and has valid parameters
  - Prevents infinite reconnection loops and API request floods
- **SECURITY**: Log injection vulnerability in WebSocket message handling
  - Modified logging to only output safe, non-user-controlled fields (status, percentage, processed count, total count)
  - Removed logging of potentially malicious user-controlled strings like key names, error messages, and close reasons
  - Prevents malicious log forging via WebSocket messages
  - Uses defensive logging approach: only log known-safe data types (numbers, enums)
- React hooks immutability issues in `useBulkJobProgress` hook
- Circular dependency in WebSocket connection callback
- TypeScript type compatibility issues between DOM and Cloudflare Workers WebSocket types
- Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections and polling intervals on component unmount
