# Cloudflare KV Manager v1.0.0

🎉 **Initial Release** - A modern, full-featured web application for managing Cloudflare Workers KV namespaces and keys, with enterprise-grade authentication via Cloudflare Access Zero Trust.

> **Note:** Features marked with 🆕 are unreleased and available in the latest development version.

## 🆕 Unreleased Features

### Batch R2 Backup & Restore
Multi-namespace backup and restore operations to/from R2 for efficient bulk management:

- **Batch Backup Selected to R2** - Back up multiple selected namespaces to R2 in a single operation
- **Batch Restore Selected from R2** - Restore multiple namespaces from R2 backups simultaneously
- **Namespace Selection Toolbar** - New action buttons appear when namespaces are selected:
  - "Backup Selected to R2" button with format selection (JSON/NDJSON)
  - "Restore Selected from R2" button with per-namespace backup selection
  - "Deselect All" button to clear selection
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress showing namespace count and completion percentage
- **Per-Namespace Processing** - Each namespace processed sequentially with individual audit logging
- **Error Handling** - Partial failures allowed; job completes even if some namespaces fail
- **Job History Integration** - Operations appear as `batch_r2_backup` and `batch_r2_restore` types

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/r2-backup/batch` - Start batch backup of multiple namespaces
- `POST /api/r2-restore/batch` - Start batch restore of multiple namespaces with backup path mapping

**Database Migration Required:**
- Migration 003 adds `metadata` column to `bulk_jobs` table for storing batch operation details
- See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for instructions

### R2 Backup & Restore
Complete R2 integration for secure namespace backups directly to Cloudflare R2 storage:

- **Backup to R2** - Create full snapshots of any namespace to R2 with one click
- **Restore from R2** - Browse and select from available backups to restore
- **List Backups** - View all backups with timestamps and file sizes
- **Format Support** - Both JSON and NDJSON backup formats supported
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress updates via HTTP polling (same as Import/Export)
- **Job History** - R2 operations appear in job history with dedicated icons
- **Organized Storage** - Backups stored at `backups/{namespaceId}/{timestamp}.json`
- **Optional Feature** - Works with or without R2 bucket configured
- **UI Integration** - New "Backup to R2" and "Restore from R2" buttons on namespace cards

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create R2 bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create kv-manager-backups

# Add to wrangler.toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BACKUP_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "kv-manager-backups"
```

**New API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/r2-backup/:namespaceId/list` - List available backups for namespace
- `POST /api/r2-backup/:namespaceId` - Start async backup to R2
- `POST /api/r2-restore/:namespaceId` - Start async restore from R2 backup

### Simplified Progress Tracking
Progress tracking has been simplified to use HTTP polling instead of WebSockets:

- **Polling-Only Approach** - Removed WebSocket complexity for more reliable progress tracking
- **1-Second Intervals** - Status polls every second until job completion
- **Automatic Downloads** - Export files download automatically when ready
- **Cleaner Code** - Reduced progress hook from 320 lines to 150 lines
- **No Connection Issues** - Eliminates WebSocket connection failures and rate limiting

**Migration Required:**
- Database migration needed for existing installations (see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md))
- Single migration file adds: `job_audit_events` table and progress tracking columns
- Idempotent and safe to run multiple times

### Advanced Job History Filters
The Job History UI now includes enterprise-grade filtering and sorting capabilities:

- **Namespace Filter** - Filter jobs by specific namespace
- **Date Range Picker** - Choose preset ranges (Last 24h, 7 days, 30 days) or select custom date range with calendar
- **Job ID Search** - Search for specific jobs by ID with partial matching
- **Error Threshold** - Filter jobs with minimum error count
- **Multi-Column Sorting** - Sort by Started At, Completed At, Total Keys, Error Count, or Progress
- **Sort Order Toggle** - Switch between ascending and descending with one click
- **Clear All Filters** - Reset all filters instantly
- **Combinable Filters** - Use multiple filters simultaneously for precise results

**Technical Details:**
- 7 new query parameters added to `GET /api/jobs` endpoint
- SQL injection prevention with whitelist validation
- Debounced search input (500ms) for optimal performance
- Calendar component with date-fns formatting
- Responsive 3-column grid layout adapting to screen size
