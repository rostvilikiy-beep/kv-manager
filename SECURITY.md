## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of KV Manager seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/neverinfamous/kv-manager/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Direct Contact**
   - Create a private issue with the `security` label
   - We will respond within 48 hours

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Your suggestions for fixing it (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

### Security Update Process

1. **Validation**: We'll confirm the vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a patch
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of the fix
4. **Disclosure**: 
   - We'll coordinate disclosure with you
   - Security advisory published
   - Release with fix deployed
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

When deploying KV Manager:

### Authentication

- **Always use Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)** in production
- Configure appropriate identity providers (GitHub OAuth, etc.)
- Set restrictive access policies
- Never disable authentication checks

### API Security

- **Protect API tokens**: Never commit tokens to version control
- Use Cloudflare Workers Secrets for sensitive data
- Set proper CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting if needed

### KV Access

- Grant minimal KV permissions needed
- Use separate API tokens for different environments
- Rotate API tokens regularly
- Audit KV access logs

### Metadata Database

- Protect D1 metadata database from accidental deletion
- Review metadata database schema regularly
- Backup metadata database periodically
- Monitor for unusual query patterns

### Environment Configuration

- Use `.env` files for local development only
- Never expose Worker secrets
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review Cloudflare Access logs regularly

### Worker Security

```bash
# Set all secrets (never hardcode)
npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_ID
npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put TEAM_DOMAIN
npx wrangler secret put POLICY_AUD
```

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS only (enforced by Cloudflare Workers)
- Configure appropriate CSP headers
- Enable Cloudflare's security features
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Known Security Considerations

### Docker Image Dependencies

The Docker image may show the following vulnerabilities in security scans:

**npm CLI Dependencies (Accepted Risk)**:
- `glob@11.0.3` - CVE-2025-64756 (HIGH): Command injection in glob CLI's `-c/--cmd` option
- `glob@10.4.5` - CVE-2025-64756 (HIGH): Command injection in glob CLI's `-c/--cmd` option  
- `tar@7.5.1` - CVE-2025-64118 (MEDIUM): Race condition vulnerability

**Why These Are Accepted Risks**:
- These vulnerabilities exist in npm's own CLI dependencies, not in our application code
- Our application uses patched versions (glob@11.1.0, tar@7.5.2) via package.json overrides
- The glob vulnerability only affects the glob CLI tool with specific flags we don't use
- The tar vulnerability is a race condition unlikely to be exploitable in Docker builds
- npm team has not yet released a version with patched dependencies (as of npm@11.6.2)
- These dependencies are only present during the Docker build process

**Alpine Base Package Vulnerabilities (Accepted Risk)**:
- `curl@8.14.1-r2` - CVE-2025-10966 (MEDIUM): No fix available from Alpine Linux
- `busybox@1.37.0-r19` - CVE-2025-46394, CVE-2024-58251 (LOW): No fixes available from Alpine Linux

We monitor these vulnerabilities and will update as soon as patches become available.

### Local Development Mode

- Mock data mode bypasses authentication for `localhost`
- **Never deploy** with `VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787`
- Ensure environment is properly configured for production

### API Token Permissions

- Worker requires **Account D1 Edit** and **Workers KV Storage Edit** permissions
- Avoid using Global API Key (use scoped API tokens)
- Review token access logs in Cloudflare dashboard

### Data Exposure

- Be cautious with sensitive data in KV namespaces
- Use Cloudflare Access policies to restrict users
- Consider additional encryption for sensitive values
- Review audit logs for potential data leaks

### Bulk Operations

- Durable Objects handle bulk operations securely
- Monitor for abuse of bulk delete operations
- Set reasonable rate limits for bulk operations
- Track bulk operation history in D1 metadata

## Security Features

KV Manager implements several security features:

- **Cloudflare Access Integration**: Enterprise-grade authentication
- **JWT Validation**: Every API request validated
- **Scoped Permissions**: Minimal required access
- **Audit Logging**: Operation history tracking
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready configuration
- **Input Validation**: Injection attack prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Via Cloudflare Workers platform
- **Protected Namespaces**: System namespaces hidden from UI

## Compliance

This project follows:

- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Cloudflare security best practices
- Zero Trust security model
- Principle of least privilege

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after validation. Subscribe to:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- GitHub Releases (security releases are tagged)
- GitHub Watch notifications

## Questions?

If you have questions about security that aren't covered here:

- Open a Discussion (for general security questions)
- Check Cloudflare's security documentation
- Review the CONTRIBUTING.md file

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (with permission).
